__Machine Learning__ curently become more populre in the Computer Engineering fileld. It generaly define how machine can think. 

Using ML user will able to predict the results. Generally there are two types of ML :

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning

In Supervised learning it learns by examples, Suppose we have different flowers and you can categorize them in different data set.
Now this will become your data which is known as training data set.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

In Unsupervised Learning it learns from previous data. It classify the data using attributes of flowers like color, size etc.
